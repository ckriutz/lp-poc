The Libertarian Party of Union County will be back at it again this weekend. We are once again working with local veterans who helped plan a grassroots collection drive to help Afghan refugees. Collections will take place this Saturday and Sunday (August 28th and 29th) from 1:30pm - 3:30pm at the following locations:



\- Cureton Town Center (8157 Kensington Dr, Waxhaw, NC) in front of the Harris Teeter.

\- Snoball Cabin (313 N Indian Trail Rd, Indian Trail, NC)



We are collecting items such as: Shampoo, toothpaste, soaps/bodywash, shaving supplies, diapers/wipes, coloring books/crayons, and hand sanitizer.



If you are unable to make it out to the donation locations this weekend, please call the numbers on the flyer and special arrangements can be made to facilitate donation acceptance. There is also an [Amazon registry](https://www.amazon.com/registries/custom/1VD3Y3MM6X808/guest-view) with needed items.
