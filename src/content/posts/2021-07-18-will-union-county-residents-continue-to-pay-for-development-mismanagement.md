For years now, the politicians of Union County have allowed for rapid overdevelopment. The problem is that they never made sure that a solid plan was in place concerning necessary infrastructure improvements to have been completed prior to or during that development. This has lead to another new problem: Lack of capacity at Union County wastewater plants.



So what is the answer given by the Union County Manager? Build a new wastewater plant. The question though is who will be paying for a new plant?



Well to answer this question, you first need to understand that the North Carolina General Assembly routinely blocks municipalities from levying impact fees on developers.



Have you figured out who will be paying for a new wastewater plant in Union County yet?\
