One of the members of the Libertarian Party of Union County, who is a veteran, has helped plan a grassroots effort for a collection drive for needed items to help Afghan refugees. Collections will take place August 21st, 28th and 29th from 1:30pm - 3:30pm at the locations in the attached flyer.

If you are unable to make it out to the donation locations at the days and times listed, please call the numbers on the flyer and special arrangements can be made to facilitate donation acceptance. There is also a QR code for an Amazon registry with needed items.
