Residents of Waxhaw may want to give the town's Capital Improvement Plan a look. \
\
One of the projects, the installation of steps and railings to one side of the pedestrian bridge (facilitate access to the relocated crosswalk and sidewalk connection to The Mill Development once that project is complete) over the train tracks, is estimated at $40,000.00.

While we understand that the price of lumber has skyrocketed and labor costs are involved, that price is for SEVEN STEPS and TWO RAILINGS.\
