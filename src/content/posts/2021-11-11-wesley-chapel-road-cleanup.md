Come join us Saturday, December 4th for our road cleanup and help give back to our community. We will be meeting in the parking lot of Wesley Chapel Elementary at 2:30pm. We will be meeting for a bite to eat at Brooklyn Pizza in Wesley Chapel afterwards.

EVERYONE is welcome!

Be sure to [RSVP on our Facebook page](https://fb.me/e/24tw22Lhp) so we bring enough equipment. \

See you there!
