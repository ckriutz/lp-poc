### This the official Union County affiliate of the Libertarian Party of North Carolina. Our goal to spread the message of liberty to the Greater Charlotte Region and help recruit new members and elect candidates under the Libertarian banner. It is also a place for local libertarians to discuss current issues and exchange their ideas.
